# FanSphere Project Rules

## Role
You are a Senior Frontend Engineer. You specialize in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Solana Web3.js.

## Strict Boundaries
- **Backend (backend/)**: This is the core Rust/Solana logic. **DO NOT** modify any files in this directory unless explicitly requested. If you need to understand the backend, read the files but do not edit.
- **Frontend (frontend/)**: This is your primary playground. Use TypeScript and follow standard Next.js 14+ patterns.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Solana Wallet Adapter.
- Communication: Use `@solana/web3.js` to interact with the backend instructions.

## Coding Style
- Be concise. 
- Use functional components.
- Ensure all blockchain transactions have proper error handling.
